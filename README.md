## Hi, I'm Sebastian 👋

I’m an Engineering Manager at **Dalberg Data Insights (DDI)**, where I build and ship AI-enabled products for teams working on global development, sustainability, and public-sector challenges.

I like turning messy, real-world information into tools people can actually use — with an emphasis on reliability, privacy, and responsible deployment.

---

## What I work on

- **AI product engineering**: taking ideas from prototype → production with clear UX, guardrails, and measurable impact  
- **Knowledge & discovery systems**: search, summarisation, and “who knows what / who’s connected to whom” workflows  
- **Data platforms**: pipelines, schemas, governance, and interfaces that make data usable (not just stored)  
- **Applied NLP + graph thinking**: blending embeddings, structured data, and relationship reasoning for better retrieval and insights

---

## Toolbox (often)

- **Backend**: Python, Postgres, Redis  
- **Data / retrieval**: vector search, graph databases, ETL pipelines  
- **Infra**: AWS, containerised deployments, CI/CD, pragmatic observability  
- **Frontend**: React-based apps for productised internal & client-facing tools

---

## What I care about

- Building systems that scale **operationally** (not just technically)
- Clear ownership, good interfaces, and boring reliability
- Responsible AI: privacy, consent, evaluation, and risk management baked in early
